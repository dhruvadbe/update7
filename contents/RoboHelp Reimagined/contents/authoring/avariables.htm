<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>Variables allow you to enter a string that can be inserted in topics, 
 topic titles, master pages, snippets, index entries and a table of contents. 
 They are used where the string could change in the future. Company and 
 product names are good examples. Instead of having of having to edit every 
 place the company or product name is used, you insert a variable. When 
 the value of that variable changes, you change it once and it cascades 
 to wherever you have used it.</p>
<p>Another scenario is where you need to change the string in different 
 outputs. For example, you might want one output for your US customers, 
 one for your UK customers and one for your Canadian customers. You can 
 create Variable Sets to create different outputs.</p>
<h2>Adding a Variable</h2>
<p>To add a variable, click the + icon and enter the name and default value 
 for the variable. To edit or delete it, click the menu that appears when 
 you hover over the variable. You can also double click to edit.</p>
<p>The name of the variable no longer has to include an underscore.</p>

<p>To use the variable, just drag it to where you want in the topic or 
 press CTRL + 1 to display a dialog with the variables listed.</p>
<p>To add a variable to the Title of an Output, place the cursor where 
 you want the variable press CTRL + 1 to display the dialog.</p>
<h2>Variable Sets</h2>
<p>Having created your variables with their default values, the next stage 
 is to create the values that will vary.</p>
<p>The Sets are selected when you configure an output and that is also 
 where the enter the different values. Select Output &gt; Output Settings 
 from the menu and you will see Variable Sets in the Project toolbar.<br/>

<p>Let&#39;s say the default values are for US users, in Output Settings you 
 click Variable Sets and the + icon and create UK Values. All the variables 
 you have created will be listed and you can apply the UK values.</p>
<p>Repeat the process for all the sets you require.</p>
<p>Later if you tick the check boxes, a Reset button allows you to revert 
 all the values to the default values so that you can start again.</p>
