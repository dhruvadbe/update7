<h1>The Skin Editor</h1>
<p>The skin editor now allows changes to both Responsive HTML5 and WebHelp 
 skins.</p>
<p>There is also a change in terminology. </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>Previously, for Responsive HTML5 help, 
	 the design was referred to as the layout. There were also problems 
	 when the functionality needed to be changed that resulted in the loss 
	 of customization.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>Now &quot;layout&quot; will refer to 
	 the structure and &quot;skin&quot; will refer to the appearance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The changes mean the terminology for both outputs is now the same and 
 Adobe can change the underpinning code of the layout without any loss 
 of customization.</p>
<p>Click Output &gt; Output Settings and then click Skins. When you select 
 what you want to edit, a preview will display on the left along with the 
 Skin Components you can customize. As you click each component, its properties 
 will be displayed on the right for editing.</p>

<h2>Customized Skins</h2>
<p>If your skin has been customized outside the <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> 
 Classic skin editor in an earlier version, go to the <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 Layout tab in Skin Components to add custom Javascript and CSS files. 
 If 508 compliance is required, see the section below.</p>
<h2>Duplicate Skins</h2>
<p>You might want to make some changes to a skin either because corporate 
 branding is about to change or you just feel that some tweaks are needed. 
 You don&#39;t want to play with the current skin though until the new one 
 is ready. With Update 5 applied, you can now create a duplicate and work 
 on that.</p>
<p>When the changes are complete, if required you can export the layout 
 to other projects.</p>
<p>Both options are in the context menu.</p>
<h2>508 Compliance</h2>
<p>With Update 6 applied, all the skins are 508 compliant with the exception 
 of Coffee. That will be made compliant later.</p>
<p>There are two elements to what is generally referred to as a &quot;skin&quot;. 
 The layout, which is the underlying structure and functionality, and the 
 skin, the appearance.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>If your project was created <span style="font-weight: bold;">after</span> 
	 applying Update 6, the supplied skins and their underlying layouts 
	 are 508 compliant, with the exception of the Coffee skin.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>If your project was created <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> 
	 Update 6 or is a project upgraded from any Classic version of RoboHelp 
	 and 508 compliance is required, the safest option is to select the 
	 required skin afresh. </p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> If in doubt, it is recommended 
 that you select a skin after applying Update 6. <br/>
Go to Output &gt; Skins and click the + icon and select the required skin. 
 You will then be able to select that skin in Output Presets &gt; Layout 
 &gt; Skin<br/>
OR<br/>
In Output Presets &gt; Layout &gt; Skin click the browse icon <img src="../assets/images/images/browse_icon.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> and select the required 
 skin.<br/>
If the project already has a skin with the same name, it will be necessary 
 to use a slightly different name to differentiate it, perhaps just append 
 &quot;508_Compliant&quot;.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Customization 
 and 508 Compliance</span><br/>
It is only the supplied layout and skin that is 508 compliant. If you apply 
 any customization to the skin, then you must ensure that too is compliant. 
 Your customization could break that if, for example, you define colors 
 that do not have the necessary contrast. You must also ensure that your 
 content is 508 compliant.</p>
