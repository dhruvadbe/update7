<h1>Printed Documentation Output</h1>
<p>There are some big changes in the generation of printed documents, the 
 key one being you no longer need to have Microsoft Word installed on your 
 computer. <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 generates PDF documents and ODF (Open Document Format) will be added  later.</p>
<h2>Creating a Printed Document Output</h2>
<p>Click Output &gt; Output Settings the first time you generate so that 
 you can configure your preset as required. After the preset is configured, 
 you can either come back here next time or you can click the Quick Generate 
 icon top right in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p>The icons above the list of presets allow you to generate an output, 
 view it or create further outputs.</p>
<h2>PDF Output</h2>
<p>The settings appear in five groups as below.</p>
<h3>General<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/print01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></h3>
<p>Variables can be included in the Title. Place the cursor where you want 
 the variable and press CTRL + 1.</p>
<p>The language should be set for the Table of Contents, Index and Glossary 
 page.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/print02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p>
<p>Most of the options here are obvious but there is a new option with 
 Update 6 applied. Previously in all versions of RoboHelp, the content 
 has been limited by design to just those topics in the print layout. With 
 Update 6 applied you can still work that way if you prefer but there is 
 an Include All Referenced Topics option. Select that and topics that are 
 not in the TOC but do have links from topics in the TOC will also get 
 included.</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>Here you have various options.</p>
<h4>Same Appearance as Online with no Header or Footer</h4>
<p>If you want the printed output to simply contain the topics using the 
 came CSS as the online help with no header or footer, leave the Master 
 Page field set to None and ignore the options on this page.</p>
<h4>Different Fonts and/or a single Header and/or Footer</h4>
<p>If you want your printed output to have different fonts and/or headers 
 and footers, you need to create at least one master page. Link the master 
 page to the required CSS and define what you want in the header/footer. 
 The header and/or footer will then be applied to all pages of your PDF 
 provided you leave the checkbox clear.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Instead of using your own master 
 page, <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 ships with an optimized PDF Master page. It is recommended that you use 
 this. If you want different odd and even master pages, create a copy and 
 name the pages to differentiate them.<br/>
If your project was created before Update 6 was released, create a new 
 project and copy the PDF master page and CSS from there into your project.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/print03.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>The PDF master page is associated with a supplied pdf.css file to give 
 you more control over the appearance. Double click the CSS file to open 
 it in the editor where you will find many styles that you can edit to 
 meet your own requirements. The appearance of the TOC can be defined up 
 to six levels.</p>
<p>Use of this CSS is recommended but you can copy the styles to your own 
 CSS if required. </p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/pdf_css.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h4>Multiple Headers and/or Footers</h4>
<p>If you want different pages to have different headers and/or footers, 
 then tick the checkbox. That will reveal the additional fields shown below 
 with the Topics fields displayed.</p>
<p>If you are using the supplied PDF master page, it is suggested that 
 you create copies of that and amend them as required.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/print04.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h5>Topics - First Page</h5>
<p>Leave as None or select the master page to be used for the first page 
 of the topic section. </p>
<p>If the same master page is to be used for all topics, tick the Apply 
 To All Topics Pages checkbox. The Even Pages and Odd Pages fields will 
 then be hidden.</p>
<h5>Topics - Even Pages and Odd Pages</h5>
<p>If different master pages are to be set for Even Pages and Odd Pages, 
 leave the checkbox clear and select the required master pages.</p>
<h5>TOC / Index and Glossary Sections</h5>
<p>You can either click the Apply To All Sections button to apply the same 
 settings to the other sections or you can click the dropdowns for each 
 and apply the required settings.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>Here you set up the page settings. Click the link icon if you want to 
 apply different top, bottom, left or right margins.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/print05.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>With Update 6 applied, you will not see the Limit TOC Depth field. That 
 is now controlled by the TOC that you associate with the PDF.</p>
<h3>Publish</h3>
<p>You can create a Publish Location for this output. Typically that will 
 be used to deliver it to developers. How this is set up is described in 
 <a href="publishing.htm">Publishing</a>.</p>
<h3>Generating the Output</h3>
<p>Once you have defined the preset, click the generate icon.</p>
<div data-conref="../assets/snippets/Cancel Generation.hts"></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Viewing the Output</h3>
<p>Click the view icon on the Output Presets toolbar. <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> can create a 
 PDF but it does not install a reader unless it is part of Adobe&#39;s Technical 
 Communication Suite. If you don&#39;t have a reader installed, you will need 
 to download one.</p>
<h2>ODF Output</h2>
<p>This feature will be supported later but these are the key points.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">The output you create can be read in Microsoft 
	 Word as well as any word processing software that supports the ODF 
	 format. For example, Open Office and Libre Office.</li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">You will not be able to map to Microsoft 
	 Word templates. Instead you will need to create a CSS file that has 
	 the styles you require.</li>
</ul>
<p>More detail will be provided in a later version of this sample project.</p>
